# Communication in Microservices

## 1. Synchronous Communication

Examples include http calls, RPC calls etc.

### RPC (Remote Procedure Calls)

Problem it solves:

1. Lets say you have a app with various microservices written in python, golang, js etc.

- writing network calls(e.g axios in js, requests in python etc.) to communicate and manage retries failure handling etc in each language becomes difficult.
-

## 2. Asynchronous Communication

Examples include RabbitMQ, Redis queues etc.
